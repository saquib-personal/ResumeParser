A Sprint Boot project that creates a single service where you upload a resume. The service parses work and education content from the resume and sends it back to the client as a JSON.
Created based on the requirements given for a job interview. It prioritises support for file types over string parsing logic for creating work/education content.
Used SOLID Principles and Clean Code rules to create code that is easy-to-read and maintainable. 

Upload the file to
URL: http://localhost:8080/resume
METHOD: POST
MANDATORY PARAMETER: file
