Responsibilities:
Worked as a part of an Agile/Scrum team to maintain a web application that served as a
repository of climate data.
Participated in code reviews to ensure high standards of code quality.
Worked on two tech stacks - Java/Spring/Hibernate/Solr/Postgres and
Python/Jinja/Flask/Solr/Postgres.
The Python web application ingested xml metadata uploaded by various laboratories at
NCAR using Git WAFs. During that time, the application became increasingly expensive
to modify. The throughput dropped as more data was added to the application.
Conferred with the Technical Lead and worked with the interns and other engineers to
replace the Python monolith with a set of microservices.
